Don Marakesh is not from here. He and his family come from a distant country, but are now here in search of opportunity.
 Don has found a new job at the local Best Buy and is entering his first day after training, assigned to the Car Stereo section.
 In a new world where the people do not even speak his language (and Don cannot even speak theirs), Don Marakesh takes on a new quest for cash.

Every since Don has been a child, he has always gotten bored and quit too easily. This new job was different. Don was going to be the best Car
 Stereo salesman this side of the Mississippi. In order to be a good salesman, Don knew he had to look the part. He needed a fedora.

He busted out the family's old plaid suit, dark brown khakis and old bronze nametag.
Don worked on a few catch phrases, "get 'em rigs while 'em good!" and "nothin' like a 'ssippi oiler".

Don practiced these catchphrases everywhere. Even on a vacation to Canada. Unfortunately, Don
failed to contemplate the consequences of loudly belting "ain't nothin' like a 'ssipi oiler" to a crowd of passionate Edmonton Oilers fans, who found themselves highly offended by Don's catchphrases. The Edmonton Oilers fans drowned Don in pure Canadian Maple Syrup, before
feeding him to wild moose. It's said that the last thing Don heard before his death was "Welcome to Edmonton, where oil's thicker'n water 'ere, eh?"
