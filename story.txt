Don Marakesh is not from here. He and his family come from a distant country, but are now here in search of opportunity. Don has found a new job at the local Best Buy and is entering his first day after training, assigned to the Car Stereo section. In a new world where the people do not even speak his language (and Don cannot even speak theirs), Don Marakesh takes on a new quest for cash.
